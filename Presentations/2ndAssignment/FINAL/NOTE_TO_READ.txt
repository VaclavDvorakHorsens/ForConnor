i define file(recipes.txt) destination in my RecepeProxy class. For some reason, i couldnt 
access root, whenever i ran the application, eclipse told me:file is not there or something. 
So, i tested that with some other file destionation ("C://SomeFolder//recipes.txt") 
and it worked ok, i assume its just something not code related so i think the root destination will work for you.
If not, please just change the path. 
thank you
